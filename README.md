## Introduction
The objective of this project is to develop an AI model that can accurately classify SMS messages as either spam or legitimate. Spam messages are unwanted and often contain unsolicited content, while legitimate messages are user-generated and expected.

The project involves preprocessing the text data, feature extraction using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), and training several classifiers to predict the classification of SMS messages.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains labeled SMS messages, where each message is tagged as spam or ham. The dataset provides the necessary ground truth for training and evaluating the models. The data is split into a training set and a testing set to assess the models' performance on unseen data.

## Installation
To run the code and reproduce the results of this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sms-spam-classification.git
   cd sms-spam-classification
   ## Usage
1. Preprocess the text data and perform feature extraction using TF-IDF.
2. Train and evaluate different classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines.
3. Compare the performance of the classifiers and select the best-performing one.
4. Fine-tune hyperparameters if necessary.

## Models
The following classifiers are implemented and evaluated in this project:

- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Each model's implementation can be found in the respective notebooks/files within the repository.

## Evaluation
The models are evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. Cross-validation and test set performance are considered to ensure the models' generalization capability.

## Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome. If you find any issues or have ideas for improvements, feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue.
