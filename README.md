# Customer Churn Prediction Project

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting customer churn in a subscription-based service or business. The project utilizes historical customer data, including features such as usage behavior and customer demographics. Algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting are employed to predict churn.

## Introduction
The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can identify customers who are likely to churn, i.e., stop using the service or business. This is valuable for businesses to take proactive measures to retain customers, reduce churn, and improve customer satisfaction.

The project involves exploring the data, preprocessing, feature engineering, and training machine learning models to predict customer churn.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical customer data, including various features such as credit score, age, tenure, balance, usage behavior, and more. The target variable indicates whether a customer has churned (1) or not (0). The data is split into a training set and a testing set for model evaluation.

## Installation
To run the code and reproduce the results of this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-churn-prediction.git
   cd customer-churn-prediction
 ##  Usage
Explore and preprocess the customer data.
Perform feature engineering and selection based on domain knowledge.
Train and evaluate different classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.
Compare the performance of the classifiers and select the best-performing one.
## Models
The following classifiers are implemented and evaluated in this project:

Logistic Regression
Random Forests
Gradient Boosting
Each model's implementation can be found in the respective notebooks/files within the repository.

##Evaluation
The models are evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. Cross-validation and test set performance are considered to ensure the models' generalization capability.

 ## Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome. If you find any issues or have ideas for improvements, feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue.
